SoulBound is a 2D top-down action RPG built with Godot, blending fast-paced combat, character progression, and life-simulation systems. Players explore a dynamic world with day–night cycles, fight enemies and bosses, collect loot influenced by luck, develop skills and talent trees, and survive through farming, crafting, and equipment upgrades.
