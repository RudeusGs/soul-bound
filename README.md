# SoulBound

SoulBound is a 2D top-down action RPG built with the Godot Engine. The game combines fast-paced combat, deep character progression, and life-simulation elements such as farming, crafting, and equipment upgrading.

Players explore a dynamic world with a day–night cycle, fight monsters and bosses, collect loot influenced by luck, and customize their playstyle through skills, talent trees, and gear. The story revolves around fate and identity, leading to a final confrontation with SoulKnight, the player’s twin.
